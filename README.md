# Web-based Library Statistics Suite

## Description
This is a web-based statistics suite for collecting library statistics and processing them for reporting, particularly with state reporting (specifically the Illinois Public Library Annual Report -- IPLAR) in mind.

It is designed to be run on a local network, not on the general internet, although I'm trying to consider a variety of ways of using it in its design, some of which might require different permission levels.

As of this writing it is in extremely early development and not in any kind of usable form.
